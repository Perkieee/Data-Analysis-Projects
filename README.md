# Metro Interstate Traffic Analysis
In this project, I will explore a dataset on westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway. Iâ€™ll analyze traffic volume data recorded by a station midway between Minneapolis and Saint Paul.
Using my data analysis skills I will determine key indicators of heavy traffic on I-94, which could include weather type, time of day, or day of the week. I will achieve this by examining traffic volume patterns across various conditions. The station only records westbound traffic (cars moving from east to west),meaning our analysis will be based on westbound traffic of that station
# Netflix-Tv-Shows-And-Movies-Analysis
Netflix TV Shows and Movies Analysis
# Movie Dataset Correlation
In this Project, I will analyze this other Movie dataset and show the correlation between Movies and their features. This dataset was initially supposed to help in analyzing the production of movies post-Netflix era.
